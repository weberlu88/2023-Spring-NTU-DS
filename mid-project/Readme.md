### Which programming language do you use?

This project is base on `C++` for Chord node. `Python3` for fuctional testing. Interacting by `rpcs` protocol. Please refer to 分散式雲端期中作業_實驗報告.pdf  
- Part1: Chrod node.  
- Part2: Add features like Data Migration, File Chunks, and Replication. 
- Part3: Deploy to AWS cloud.
